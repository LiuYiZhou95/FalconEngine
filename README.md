You would find a lot of copy and paste code currently in this repository, mainly
from the David Eberly's [Geometry Tool](https://www.geometrictools.com/)
Project. I am learning to build a graphics engine for study purpose. Doing so
may help me learn faster by provide the necessary code structure and logics.
Eventually, all the copied code will be replaced by my code and I don't claim
the ownership of entire code base.
